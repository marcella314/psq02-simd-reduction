# PSQ02 ‚Äî Paralelize-me se for Capaz: Desvendando SIMD e CUDA

## üìå Descri√ß√£o
Este reposit√≥rio cont√©m a implementa√ß√£o do problema cl√°ssico de **redu√ß√£o de vetor** (soma e m√°ximo) em duas arquiteturas diferentes:

- **CPU (SIMD ‚Äì AVX2)**: usando intr√≠nsecas Intel em C++  
- **GPU (CUDA)**: usando kernels CUDA em C++/CUDA

Objetivo: comparar desempenho e observar ganhos de paralelismo em n√≠vel de dados.

üìä Resultados Obtidos

**CPU (SIMD AVX2)**

**Exemplo de sa√≠da (cpu/resultados_cpu.csv)**
